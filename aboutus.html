					We are very lucky that the very first point of sale was Duty Free. They immediately bought half of the goods from us. Plus, for me personally, it was a good motivation, means we are on the right track. Now we have more than 40 points throughout Kazakhstan. We work with such companies as «Meloman», «Shymbulak», «Gazpromneft», a network of coffee shops Angel-in-us Coffee. We would like to open a boutique in MEGA network, as we see good sales figures for our goods in Marwin «Meloman» stores, which are located in these shopping malls.
