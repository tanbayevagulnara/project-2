					The history of the Qazaq Republic brand began with the fact that its founder Saken Zholdas did not join the criticism of the city logo approved by Akimat of Almaty, but offered his own and shared it on Facebook. Today this brand is chosen by well-known personalities — Dinara Satzhan, Alisher Elikbaev, Erlan Karin, Bagdat Mussin and other.

					We are very lucky that the very first point of sale was Duty Free. They immediately bought half of the goods from us. Plus, for me personally, it was a good motivation, means we are on the right track. Now we have more than 40 points throughout Kazakhstan. We work with such companies as «Meloman», «Shymbulak», «Gazpromneft», a network of coffee shops Angel-in-us Coffee. We would like to open a boutique in MEGA network, as we see good sales figures for our goods in Marwin «Meloman» stores, which are located in these shopping malls.

			We will open our first store in Almaty in August. The second store will also open in Almaty in late 2019, and then every year we want to open two shops.

The following cities will be: Astana, Shymkent, Pavlodar, Karaganda, Aktobe. In total, we plan to open 25-30 stores in the next 15 years.
